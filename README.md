This CLI tool makes use of the [rn2483 api](https://github.com/BulletTime/RN2483) to configure and use the LoRaMote module
as a gateway.

This is a work in progress and does not support LoRaWAN at the moment. Keep in mind that the LoRaMote can't replace a real
gateway as this module can only receive on a fixed frequency and spreading factor in contrast with a real gateway.
